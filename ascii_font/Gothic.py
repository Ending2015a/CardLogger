# Gothic.flf - Taken from a banner program called "gothic" by Howard Chu
# Figletization suggested bu Bob Bright (bright@cc.umanitoba.ca)
# Figletized by Wendell Hicken 11/19/93 (whicken@parasoft.com)
# Version 1.1 - updated on 11/23/93
# Version 1.11 - updated on 11/28/93 by Brian Tao (taob@io.org)
#              - adjusted baseline and fixed some spacing problems
# Explanation of first line:
# flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
# a    - should always be `a', for now
# $    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
# 9    - height of a character
# 8    - height of a character, not including descenders
# 14   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
# -1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
# 16   - number of comment lines
